you can either hardcode the APItoken directly in Qconfig OR set it as an environment variable. If the token is hardcoded in Qconfig, it is OVERRIDES the valueof the environment variable.\r\n\r\nalso added some robustness. There is a new method update_token which gets called when you import the Qconfig. \r\nImagine the scenario where you have already imported the Qconfig module,  and then changed your API token. In this case you can either reload the Qconfig module or just call Qconfig.update_token() method to update the `APItoken`. \r\n\r\n@rraymondhp @jaygambetta
